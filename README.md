## Overview

This repository contains a device handler for use of the Fibaro [RGBW Controller](https://www.fibaro.com/en/products/rgbw-controller) with Samsung's [SmartThings](http://www.smartthings.com) home automation platform.

#### [Fibaro RGBW Controller (FGRGBWM-441)](https://github.com/tamarindmonkey/SmartThings-Fibaro_RGBW_DTH/tree/master/devicetypes/tamarindmonkey/fibaro-rgbw-controller-advanced.src):
 - This device handler is written specifically for the Fibaro RGBW Controller (FGRGBWM-441).
 - It extends the native SmartThings device handler to support editing the device's parameters from the SmartThings GUI, and to support the use of one or more of the controller's channels in IN/OUT mode (i.e. analog sensor inputs).
